 * Proxy: return the fastest response from given list of origins.
 *
 * The main idea is that real-world latency depends on a lot on the exact time and location.
 * So the best strategy to optimize for latency would be to try several origins,
 * all at the same time and only return the first received response.
 *
 * WARNING: this will also return the first error or non 200 response as well. So it is
 * not a good-idea(TM), to use this for any kind of high-availability or redundant setup.
